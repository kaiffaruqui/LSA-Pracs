Theory:-
In Linux, the Secure Shell (SSH) is a method where you can access another computer through a secure and two-way encrypted communication system over the internet. 
By enabling the SSH service in Linux, you can use the SSH protocol as an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server or, you can get remote access to another Pc. 
Enabling SSH service can connect your device to another device or server through a secure tunnel where your identity and data transmissions are totally safe and encrypted.
If you are a network administrator, you must know how to enable and configure the SSH service in Linux.

Step 1:-
Install openssh-server package.
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
Step 2:-
Configure firewall to allow ssh traffic
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
Step 3:-
Check if ssh service automatically started and is running.
$ sudo systemctl status ssh
Step 4:-
Start the ssh service if it's not already started.
$ sudo systemctl start ssh
Step 5:-
Disable ssh from automatically started during system boot if required. 
$ sudo systemctl disable ssh
Configure SSH server to automaticall start during system boot if required
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh
Configure SSH server options by editing the configuration file using your favorite editor. 
$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Restart SSH service for any changes to take effect. 
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh




THEORY:-
NFS (Network File Share) is a protocol that allows you to share directories and files with other Linux clients in a network. 
The directory to be shared is usually created on the NFS server and files added to it.
The client systems mount the directory residing on the NFS server, which grants them access to the files created.
NFS comes in handy when you need to share common data among client systems especially when they are running out of space.

Steps:-
Install NFS Kernel Server in Ubuntu
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
Create an NFS Export Directory
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_share
Give permissions
$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/nfs_share/
Grant NFS Share Access to Client Systems
$ sudo vim /etc/exports
/mnt/nfs_share  192.168.43.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
To grant access to client
/mnt/nfs_share  client_IP_1 (re,sync,no_subtree_check)
Export the NFS Share Directory
$ sudo exportfs -a
$ sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
Allow NFS Access through the Firewall
$ sudo ufw allow from 192.168.43.0/24 to any 2049
enable the firewall
$ sudo ufw enable
$ sudo ufw status
Install the NFS-Common Package
$ sudo apt install nfs-common
Create a NFS Mount Point on Client
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs_clientshare
Mount NFS Share on Client System
$ ifconfig
$ sudo mount 192.168.43.234:/mnt/nfs_share  /mnt/nfs_clientshare
 Testing the NFS Share on Client System
 $ cd /mnt/nfs_share/
$ touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
$ ls -l /mnt/nfs_clientshare/
